# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game, where two players take turns marking X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If the grid is filled and no player has achieved this, the game ends in a tie.
The game logic, including win detection and game flow, is constructed using fundamental digital logic components, making it an excellent exercise in understanding how combinational and sequential logic work together to create a functional system.
## Features
- **Two-player mode**: Play against another person locally.
- **Win and Tie Detection**: Automatically detects wins and ties, displaying the result at the end of the game.
- **Illegal Move Detection**: Automatically detects if a player attempts to place their mark in an already occupied cell, preventing invalid moves and ensuring fair gameplay.
